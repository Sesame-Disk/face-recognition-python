 face recognition in python

I have uploaded all the code files on this Github repository for everything on this post at Sesame Disk about face recognition in Python: https://sesamedisk.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=5351&action=edit
Face recognition refers to using the rules and protocols of face detection in Python to "recognize" faces by comparing their facial encodings to a database of stored images that it compiles or stores during face detection. 
Simply, face recognition in Python goes beyond face detection, which is its first application before it uses that information to compare it to stored data from images and recognize or identify the person in the digital image or video.
